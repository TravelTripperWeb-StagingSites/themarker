He&rsquo;s been here ever since.</em></p>\n  <p>Like countless others, the New Jersey native fell in love with island life: the sun, the surf, and the wild mix of friendly faces. Today, Mager shares his love of Key West through <strong>Lloyd&rsquo;s Tropical Bike Tours</strong>, which offers easy, two-hour tours of the island&rsquo;s exotic beauty. Not in the mood to pedal?

It was a private yacht. It traded spices between India and Boston. It even engaged German U-boats during World War II. Then in 1946, the impressive ship settled in Provincetown, Massachusetts, a seaside community not unlike Key West, where it entered a new era as a tourist attraction: first for whale watching and now, under the ownership of Key West&rsquo;s William Rowan, a floating piece of history that offers daily sails to visitors. During <strong>Definitely Knot Work</strong>, guests will learn the basics boat knots, then hop on board for a tour or sunset cruise.<br>\n    <strong>When: Sundays, December 14, 21 &amp; 28 (2-4 PM)</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>20 Inches</strong><br>\n    <em>That&rsquo;s the approximate length of a standard ukulele.</em></p>\n  <p>Size doesn&rsquo;t matter.

(The horrors!) Unwilling to stop the party, the Keys enjoyed a colorful history of bootlegging rum during the Prohibition Era. But it wasn&rsquo;t until last year, when local restaurateur Paul Menta launched <strong>Chef Distilled</strong>, that Key West received its first legal rum distillery. Menta brought his culinary background to the booze-making process, using Florida sugar cane with infusions like coconut, vanilla crème brûlée and Key lime. And his team of modern rumrunners will guide you through the flavors during <strong>Rum Rum in the Sun!</strong><br>\n    <strong>When: Wednesdays, December 17, 24 &amp; 31 (4-6 PM)</strong></p>\n  <p><strong>20 Minutes</strong><br>\n    <em>That&rsquo;s all it takes for yoga to boost your brainpower.</em></p>\n  <p>And no, it&rsquo;s not because &ldquo;Downward Dog&rdquo; made all the blood rush to your head.
