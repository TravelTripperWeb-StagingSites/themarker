After the original sign marking this spot was stolen, the City of Key West decided to erect something that was nearly impossible to steal. The massive concrete landmark is now the subject of many Key West travel <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/southernmostpoint/\">photos on Instagram</a>.

Located 6 nautical miles southwest of Key West, between the Sand Key Channel and Rock Key Channel, is the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/11434041/\">Sand Key Lighthouse</a>. It is a great spot for snorkeling and diving, so you can even break out the GoPro for an underwater Instagram photo shoot. This landmark truly offers a great experience to capture by boat, land or underwater dive!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/2577383/\">Top of Shipwreck Museum View</a></h3>\n<p>Get a&nbsp;360&deg; view of Key West at the <a href=\"http://www.keywestshipwreck.com/\">Key West Shipwreck Museum</a>. Climb aboard the &nbsp; &nbsp;65-foot-tall tower to get sweeping panorama pics of the Southernmost City. While you&rsquo;re there, brush up on Key West&rsquo;s history, which is deeply rooted in maritime and wrecker activity, and led to much of the financial success of the city.

Take your pup for a walk and snap a cute picture, because everyone loves the <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/dogsofinstagram/\">#dogsofinstagram</a>! Or you can grab a cup of <a href=\"http://www.themarkerkeywest.com/blog-details/a-taste-of-cuban-coffee-in-key-west\">Cuban coffee</a> and watch the sunrise from the pier.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sloppyjoesbarkeywest/\">Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s</a></h3>\n<div>Historically, <a href=\"https://sloppyjoes.com/\">Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s</a> has been one of Key West&rsquo;s go to saloons. It was originally located across the street, but moved to its current location in 1937. Unless you were Hemingway, you would never know the difference as it&rsquo;s just as rich with charm, posters and local treasures. Sloppy Joe&rsquo;s is open 365 days a year, so you can get a great photo no matter the day. Our recommendation: Take a photo of the exterior at night. The neon lends itself to a beautiful, glowing Instagram!&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/214485592/\">Mallory Square</a></h3>\n</div>\n<div>Busy with live events, museums, and <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.mallorysquare.com/sunset-celebration/\">sunset celebrations</a>, Malloy Square is the place to see entertainment ranging from psychics, musicians, clowns, magicians and food vendors of the Keys. Take the time to see what local artists are selling, which could range from jewelry, clothes, artwork and more! With all the entertainment, you&rsquo;re sure to get a <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mallorysquare/\">great action shot for your Instagram</a>, complete with a backdrop of the breathtaking sunset.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/334495/\">Hemingway House</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hemingwayhome.com/\">The Hemingway House</a> is just one Instagrammable moment after another! With its rich history, beautiful <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayhome.com/architectural-details/\">architectural details</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hemingwayhome.com/cats/\">six-toed cats</a>, and a crystal clear pool, it&rsquo;s hard to choose just one thing to capture during a single visit.
